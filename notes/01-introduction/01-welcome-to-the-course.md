# Welcome To The Course

Welcome to Traversy Media's **PHP From Scratch** course. This course is designed for both beginners and experienced developers alike. I designed it for learners who want to grasp both the basics and advanced concepts of PHP programming. The course kicks off with beginner-friendly sections, where you'll dive into fundamental PHP topics such as data types, functions, iteration, and object-oriented programming. This foundation is crucial for understanding the core principles of PHP.

As the course progresses, we shift gears towards a hands-on, project-based approach. We will be building a job listing website from scratch. One thing that I want to make clear about this project is that it's not about building a job listing website. In all honesty, the project could be anything. The goal of the project is to give you a real-world example of how to build a PHP application from scratch. You don't find many courses that take this approach. Most courses focus on teaching you the basics of PHP, or jumping into a framework like Laravel. This course and this project are meant for you to understad how a framework like Laravel works under the hood. That's why this is a great precursor to learning Laravel. In fact in the coming months, I'll be releasing a Laravel course and we're going to be building the same project, but with Laravel and with more features. Laravel gives us a ton of features out of the box, so building this project would be really easy. In this course, we'll be creating everything from the ground up.

- We'll be creating the directory structure separating the core or framework of our application from things like controllers and views.
- We'll create our own router inspired by the Laravel framework. It will even be able to handle middleware for authorization to protect routes
- We'll also be using Laravel-like namespacing and autoloading to keep our code organized and clean.
- We'll use the PSR-4 standard for autoloading classes using Composer
- We'll create our own database class that works with PDO to handle all of our database interactions.
- We'll create our own authentication system and relate users to job listings
- We'll be able to search for jobs by keyword and location

So we're doing this all without the help of any framework or library. That's what I want to stress. We're going to be building this from scratch. This is a great way to learn how to build a PHP application. It's also a great way to learn how a framework like Laravel works under the hood.

## How To Use This Course

There's a few ways to take this course and depends on your skill level. If you're a beginner, I recommend going through the course in order. If you're more experienced, you can skip the beginner sections or just jump around to the things that you're not 100% comfortable with and then jump right into the project. You can always go back and review the beginner sections if you need to. What I don't want is more experienced developers starting the beginner sections and saying this course is too easy and giving up. I promise you that it gets more advanced as we go along.

Alright, I think you guys will learn a lot. So let's get started.
