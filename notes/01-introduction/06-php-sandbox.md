# PHP Sandbox

So this course is really broken into two parts. The first is full of learning modules to learn the fundamentals and the syntax of PHP. This includes data types, functions, loops, superglobals, working with a database and PDO. So each lesson will have independent code. I have all of the code for you in something called a `sandbox`. This is so you have the code for reference later. If you purchased the course from traversymedia.com, you also have the premium documentation with not only all the code but written explanations as well. The second part of the course will be a job listings project where we setup a vanilla PHP website from scratch with sort of a custom framework. If you're already comfortable with PHP, then you may want to skip around the first part or just go right for the second. It's completely up to you.

Now as far as the sandbox goes, you will have 2 zip files to download in this lesson. If you are watching this portion of the course on YouTube, I will have a link in the description. One is labeled `php-sandbox-starter`. This will have all of the start code for each lesson. The other is called `php-sandbox-finished`, which will be the final code.

## Starter Code

Many of the lessons will have some starter code, whether that be just HTML or HTML and PHP. You can either copy the starter code for each project and paste it in your work file or you can just rename `php-sandbox-starter` to `php-sandbox` and use that as your work folder. I am just going to copy any starter code for that lesson into the current file and go from there.

Alright, so download those files, make sure you have PHP installed and a server to run wether that is the built-in PHP server or an Apache server via Laragon or Xampp or something else. In the next section, we'll get started on the learning modules.
