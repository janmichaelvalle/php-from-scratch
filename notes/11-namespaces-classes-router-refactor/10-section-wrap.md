# Section Wrap Up

Alright, so I just wanted to say a couple things before we wrap this section up.

In this section, we've made significant progress in establishing the core infrastructure of our project and its underlying framework. While it may not seem like we've added many visible changes to the user interface or functionality, it's essential to understand that backend development often involves a substantial amount of work on the project's structure and organization. This is much different than frontend UI stuff with JavaScript frameworks like React. It's also very different than a project that uses a backend framework, because even with something like Laravel, you have so many tools at your disposal and that infrastructure is already there for you to use. In this project, we're creating that from scratch. Which personally, I love doing.

I also want to sat that I know that this section was a lot of information and it may have been a bit overwhelming for some of you. I just want to say that it's totally fine if you didn't understand every single line of code.

In reality, you won't be doing this kind of stuff that much because you'll most likely be using a framework like Laravel or Symphony. However, I think it's important to know how things work under the hood. I think it makes you a better developer overall. Now when you're setting routes in Laravel, you have a basic understanding of what is happening and why that works. It's no longer just magic. Of course, Laravel is way more complex, but you get the idea.

So now that we have a solid framework or infrastructure for our project, we can continue building our actual application with new controllers and views. We'll start to add functionality to create, update and delete listings, we'll be working with sessions and authentication, custom middleware, etc.

Alright, let's move on!
