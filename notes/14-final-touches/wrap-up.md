# Wrap Up

Alright, so that's it. At least for now. I may add to this in the future. There's a lot of other features that could be added to this app, but I think this is a good stopping point for now.

Let's go over what we've learned.

The first half of the course was more beginner level stuff. We learned about PHP syntax, variables, arrays, functions, conditionals, loops, and more. We also learned about the superglobals and how to use them. We did a tiny blog project showing how to use PDO and work with a database.

The project is the bread and butter of this course. Not so much the UI and the functionality, but the core of the project. The custom router, autoloading, namespaces, and MVC-like structure. We also learned about authentication, hashing passwords and authorization. We learned about sessions and cookies. We learned about sanitization and validation. We learned about prepared statements and how to prevent SQL injection attacks. We learned about flash messages and more.

I think that this will give you a great foundation to build on. Especially if you plan on moving to Laravel or another framework. You'll have a good understanding of how things work under the hood and I think you'll see a lot of similarities.

Thanks so much for taking the course. I really appreciate it and I hope you enjoyed it.
